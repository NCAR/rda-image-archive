# imagearchive

## system requirements

requirement | progress | notes
--- | --- | ---
https addresses for images | 6/10 | need to point a server at 'data_dir'
tar archive from result set | 9/10 | needs integration testing
file level metadata | 9/10 | done, but 'wid' should be linked to the 'dsarch' utility
interface for SQL queries | 5/10 | unless Tom wants to learn SQLalchemy, needs a raw interface
jupyter notebooks to reflect new functionality | 5/10 | was not my priority until the module-level functionality was further along
view images in a query result set | 9/10 | needs integration testing
